# tsf-task06-trafficsignrecognition

This was my sixth task as a Computer Vision & IoT intern at The Sparks Foundation, in this task I was told to build traffic sign recognition & classification system. For this task I simply used a Convolutional Neural Network which was trained on ~4000 images and used it to classify any image with a traffic sign into any of the 43 given classes.

The dataset, additional files & code can be downloaded at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15qvPEXFOV5-WXnjRlP0yxTpgkC2nEuRv?usp=sharing

A video demonstration of the code can be seen at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2ChBS1KEcQ

Feel free to give any suggestions regarding this task. Thank you
